module TransactionService::Gateway

  # This is an interface for gateway adapters to provide transaction
  # process settings and validate gateway configurations. In a better
  # world we wouldn't need tx_process_settings method because this is
  # per transaction process configuration, not gateway level
  # stuff. But currently BT (and Checkout) settings have not been
  # migrated away from old locations making settings handling gateway
  # specific.
