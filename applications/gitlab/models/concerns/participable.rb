# == Participable concern
#
# Contains functionality related to objects that can have participants, such as
# an author, an assignee and people mentioned in its description or comments.
#
# Used by Issue, Note, MergeRequest, Snippet and Commit.
#
# Usage:
#
#     class Issue < ActiveRecord::Base
#       include Participable
#
#       # ...
#
#       participant :author, :assignee, :notes, ->(current_user) { mentioned_users(current_user) }
#     end
#
#     issue = Issue.last
#     users = issue.participants
#     # `users` will contain the issue's author, its assignee,
#     # all users returned by its #mentioned_users method,
#     # as well as all participants to all of the issue's notes,
#     # since Note implements Participable as well.
#
