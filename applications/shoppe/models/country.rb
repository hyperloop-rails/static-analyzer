  # The Shoppe::Country model stores countries which can be used for delivery & billing
  # addresses for orders.
  #
  # You can use the Shoppe::CountryImporter to import a pre-defined list of countries
  # into your database. This automatically happens when you run the 'shoppe:setup'
  # rake task.
